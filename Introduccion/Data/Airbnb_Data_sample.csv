Treat this house as if it is your own with the proper respect and courtesy.  No pets allowed.  Check in is 4PM, Check out 10AM.  On Check out date please leave all the dirty sheets, towels, linens by the washer for the maid.  Please leave the outside trash container for the garbage truck on the night before it arrives.",

Please do not put baby wipes, diapers, paper towels, feminine products, etc. into the toilet. We are on a city sewer system over which the city planted trees.
